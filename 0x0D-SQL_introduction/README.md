# Tasks

#### 0. List databases

* Write a script that lists all databases of your MySQL server.

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Enter password: 
Database                                                                                     
hbtn_0c_0

[solution](0-list_databases.sql)

#### 1. Create a database

* Write a script that creates the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.

-> If the database hbtn_0c_0 already exists, your script should not fail
-> You are not allowed to use the SELECT or SHOW statements

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 1-create_database_if_missing.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Enter password: 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Enter password: 
Database
information_schema
hbtn_0c_0
mysql
performance_schema
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 1-create_database_if_missing.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Enter password: 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ 
```

#### CREATE DATABASE Statement

```
CREATE {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF NOT EXISTS] dbname
    [create_option] ...

create_option: [DEFAULT] {
    CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name
  | COLLATE [=] collation_name
  | ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}
}
```

* An error occurs if the database exists and you did not specify `IF NOT
EXIST`

* `CREATE DATABASE` is not permitted within a session that has an active
`LOCK TABLES` statement.

* A db in MySQL is implemented as a directory containing files that correspond
to tables in the db.Bec. there are no tables in a db when it is initially
created, the CREATE DATABASE statement creates only a dir. under MySQL data
dir.

* When you create a db, let the server manage the dir. and files in it.
Manipulating db dirs can cause inconsistencty.

# DROP DATABASE Statement

```
DROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] db_name
```

* DROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the database. 
Be very careful with this statement! To use DROP DATABASE, you need the 
DROP privilege on the database. DROP SCHEMA is a synonym for DROP DATABASE.i

* When a database is dropped, privileges granted specifically for the 
database are not automatically dropped. They must be dropped manually.

* IF EXISTS is used to prevent an error from occurring if the database 
does not exist.

* If the default database is dropped, the default database is unset (the DATABASE() function returns NULL).

If you use DROP DATABASE on a symbolically linked database, both the link and the original database are deleted.

DROP DATABASE returns the number of tables that were removed.

* If other files or directories remain in the database directory after MySQL removes those just listed, 
the database directory cannot be removed. In this case, you must remove any remaining files or directories manually 
and issue the DROP DATABASE statement again.
