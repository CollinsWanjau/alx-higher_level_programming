# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Tasks

#### 0. Safe list printing:
* Write a function that prints x elements of a list.
* Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):

* `pass` is used in this case to handle the `IndexError` that may
occur when `x` is greater than the length of the list, but it doesn't do
anything
